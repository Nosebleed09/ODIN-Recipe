        </h3>
        <p>
            Gulab Jamun is a classic Indian sweet made from deep-fried khoya (milk solids) balls soaked in a fragrant sugar syrup. The balls are cooked until golden brown and then soaked in a warm syrup flavored with cardamom and rose water, creating a soft, syrupy dessert.

            Lets cook it !

        <h4>Prepare the Sugar Syrup:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the syrup</strong>: In a large pan, combine sugar and water. Heat the mixture until the sugar dissolves completely.</li>
            <li><strong>Flavor the syrup</strong>: Add the crushed cardamom pods and saffron strands (if using). Let the syrup simmer on low heat for 5-7 minutes until it thickens slightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Add rose water</strong>: Turn off the heat and stir in the rose water or essence. Keep the syrup warm.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Prepare the Gulab Jamun:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the dough</strong>: In a mixing bowl, combine crumbled khoya, all-purpose flour, and baking powder. Mix well.</li>
            <li><strong>Add milk</strong>: Gradually add milk, a little at a time, and gently knead the mixture into a soft, smooth dough. Be careful not to over-knead.</li>
            <li><strong>Shape the dough</strong>: Divide the dough into small, equal-sized balls (about the size of a marble). Ensure there are no cracks on the surface to avoid the gulab jamun breaking during frying.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat the oil</strong>: Heat ghee or oil in a deep pan over low to medium heat. The oil should be moderately hot but not too hot, as the gulab jamun need to cook slowly and evenly.</li>
            <li><strong>Fry the gulab jamun</strong>: Gently drop the balls into the oil and fry them on low heat, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown. This process may take 6-8 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Soak in syrup</strong>: Once fried, remove the gulab jamun from the oil and immediately place them in the warm sugar syrup. Let them soak for at least 1-2 hours to absorb the syrup fully.</li>
        </ol>
