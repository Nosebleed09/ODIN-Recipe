        </h3>
        <p>
            Roti is a staple Indian flatbread made from whole wheat flour, water, and sometimes a bit of oil or ghee. Itâ€™s rolled out into thin discs and cooked on a hot tawa or pan until lightly charred and puffed. It's commonly served with curries, vegetables, and other dishes.

            Lets cook it !
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix the flour and salt</strong>: In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt (if using).</li>
            <li><strong>Add water gradually</strong>: Slowly add water to the flour, mixing it with your fingers to form a dough. Start with a little water and add more as needed. The dough should be soft but not sticky.</li>
            <li><strong>Knead the dough</strong>: Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and pliable. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour; if it's too dry, add a bit more water. You can also add a teaspoon of oil or ghee while kneading for extra softness.</li>
            <li><strong>Rest the dough</strong>: Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Divide and roll</strong>: After resting, divide the dough into small, equal-sized balls (about the size of a golf ball). Flatten a ball slightly, dust it with flour, and roll it out into a thin, round disc (about 6-7 inches in diameter).</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the roti</strong>: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat a tawa or flat pan on medium heat. Once hot, place the rolled-out roti on the pan.</li>
                    <li>Cook for about 30 seconds or until you see bubbles forming. Flip the roti.</li>
                    <li>Cook the other side for another 30 seconds until light brown spots appear.</li>
                    <li>Press gently with a cloth or spatula, allowing the roti to puff up.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Optional step</strong>: If you prefer, after cooking both sides, you can place the roti directly on an open flame using tongs to let it puff up fully. Quickly remove from the flame.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong>: Brush the cooked roti with ghee or butter if desired, and serve hot with your favorite curry or side dish.</li>
        </ol>
