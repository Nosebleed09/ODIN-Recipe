Here's a simple recipe for making Roti (Indian flatbread):

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup whole wheat flour (atta)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)
- 1/2 cup water (adjust as needed)
- 1 teaspoon oil or ghee (optional, for kneading)

### Instructions:
1. **Mix the flour and salt**: In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt (if using).
2. **Add water gradually**: Slowly add water to the flour, mixing it with your fingers to form a dough. Start with a little water and add more as needed. The dough should be soft but not sticky.
3. **Knead the dough**: Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and pliable. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour; if it's too dry, add a bit more water. You can also add a teaspoon of oil or ghee while kneading for extra softness.
4. **Rest the dough**: Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.
5. **Divide and roll**: After resting, divide the dough into small, equal-sized balls (about the size of a golf ball). Flatten a ball slightly, dust it with flour, and roll it out into a thin, round disc (about 6-7 inches in diameter).
6. **Cook the roti**: 
   - Heat a tawa or flat pan on medium heat. Once hot, place the rolled-out roti on the pan.
   - Cook for about 30 seconds or until you see bubbles forming. Flip the roti.
   - Cook the other side for another 30 seconds until light brown spots appear.
   - Press gently with a cloth or spatula, allowing the roti to puff up.
7. **Optional step**: If you prefer, after cooking both sides, you can place the roti directly on an open flame using tongs to let it puff up fully. Quickly remove from the flame.
8. **Serve**: Brush the cooked roti with ghee or butter if desired, and serve hot with your favorite curry or side dish.
